This is the final project for the Shader Programming course I took during my time at UW-Stout. This project utilizes Blueprint in Unreal Engine 5 to create a decorated "tech demo" scene using a variety of shaders, visual effects, procedural content generation, and lighting techniques.

You can view the completed scene under the Content/Austin/FinalProject folder, as well as other work done throughout the course in the Content/Austin/ClassWork and Content/Austin/Project2 folders.
